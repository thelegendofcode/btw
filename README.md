# BTW is a Babel-Typescript-Webpack boilerplate

Just something ~~simple~~ to get the initial config phase out of the way and just start hacking away.

### This boilerplate contains the following buzzwords
- babel7
- typescript
- eslint
- prettier
- webpack
- dotenv
- circleCI

## Why not just use create-react-app / Angular-cli / Vue-cli?

Re-inventing the wheel is a fun learning experience.
